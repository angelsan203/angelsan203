### Hi there üëã

My name is √Ångel S√°nchez and I want to become a great Bioinformatician!

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on a population genomics pipeline based on bash. Thats the PopGenANGSD repository. Feel free to explore my repositories and give some feedback! I love improving what I already did! 

```Python

name = '√Ångel S√°nchez Dom√≠nguez'
print('Hi there') 
print('My pronouns are: "he" | "him"')

learning = ['Python', 'Bash', 'RScript']
want_2_learn = ['C#','JavaScript', 'C++']
professional_interests = ['Bioinformatics', 'Biostatistics',
'Computational biology','Functional Genomics',
'Omic Technologies', 'Data Science']
other_interest = ['Gaming','Languages','Music']

print('Currently I'm part of a investigation group at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey called Core Lab Genomics')
```
